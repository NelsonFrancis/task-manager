This project is a full-stack web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). It provides a seamless and responsive user experience with secure authentication, dynamic data handling, and modern UI/UX design.

Frontend (React.js):

- Built with React.js for a fast, interactive, and component-based UI.
- Utilizes React Router for smooth navigation and protected routes.
- Styled using CSS/Bootstrap for responsive layouts.
- Backend (Node.js & Express.js):
- RESTful API architecture to handle CRUD operations.
- Middleware for request validation, error handling, and authentication.
- Secure cookies/JWT for login sessions.

Database (MongoDB):

- NoSQL schema designed for flexible data storage.

Key Features:

- User registration, login, and authentication.
- Task/item management with create, update, delete.
- Real-time updates and dynamic content rendering.
- Secure API endpoints with JWT/cookie-based protection.
- Fully responsive design accessible across devices.

This MERN application demonstrates end-to-end development skills â€” from designing a database schema and building RESTful APIs, to implementing a polished React frontend with secure route protection.
